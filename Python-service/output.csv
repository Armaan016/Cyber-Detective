httpsblogmorphiseccomhow-ai-enabled-capabilities-are-transforming-cybersecurity,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized nearly every sector, and cybersecurity is no exception. As cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, AI is transforming how both vendors and defenders approach these evolving challenges. I recently joined Chief Technology Officer and AI visionary Benjamin Bohman for an episode of AI Insights: The Executive Brief where we covered the profound impact of AI on cybersecurity, including its role in combating alert fatigue, streamlining behavioral analytics, and shaping future defense mechanisms.

The Rise of AI in Cybersecurity

The rise of AI in cybersecurity isn’t a recent phenomenon. Behavioral analytics, a core AI capability, has been evolving since 2012. Initially, AI's role focused on analyzing user behavior to detect anomalies, such as unusual login patterns or data transfers. Over the years, this has expanded into machine learning and deep learning applications that are far more complex, using vast datasets to predict potential threats and automate defenses.

But what’s really driving the conversation today is how rapidly AI is evolving. More than 80% of cybersecurity vendors are now integrating AI into their systems, building out different models and leveraging tools like generative AI and OpenAI. These innovations help companies stay ahead of the ever-growing cyber threat landscape.

AI vs. AI: The Cybersecurity Arms Race

The current cybersecurity environment can be described as ""Machine vs. Machine."" Cybersecurity vendors are deploying AI-enabled defenses, but cybercriminals are equally quick to embrace AI-driven attacks. This dynamic has turned the traditional “cat and mouse” game between attackers and defenders into an AI arms race.

Both sides are leveraging AI to automate processes. Defenders use AI for threat detection, while attackers are developing automated tools to breach defenses. The more sophisticated these systems become, the more critical it is to evolve detection and defense mechanisms. In this high-speed AI-fueled battle, cybersecurity vendors are constantly refining their capabilities to stay one step ahead. The challenge is to deploy AI models that are resilient and less susceptible to being compromised by adversaries.

AI's Achilles Heel: Lack of Guardrails

While AI offers enormous potential, it’s not without its risks. As companies increasingly rely on AI, one significant concern is the lack of ""guardrails""—or safeguards—built into these systems. Without proper oversight, AI can lead companies into dangerous territory. We’re moving at breakneck speeds with AI, likened to “driving 200 mph with no seatbelts or guardrails.”

AI models, while highly efficient, are not foolproof. They can be “poisoned” by attackers who trick them into making incorrect decisions, or they can fail to detect novel threats. As most cybersecurity vendors invest in AI, the rush to implement new technologies often prioritizes profit over safety, increasing the likelihood of vulnerabilities.

Defense in Depth: Beyond AI

While AI plays a critical role in modern cybersecurity, it is not a complete solution. AI-based models can only do so much, and as these systems evolve, defenders need strategies that can adapt when AI systems fall short. This is where approaches like Automated Moving Target Defense (AMTD) come into play.

AMTD essentially ""morphs"" the attack surface, creating an ever-shifting environment that makes it harder for attackers to gain a foothold. Think of it as a kaleidoscope or funhouse mirror—by constantly changing the landscape, AMTD provides an additional layer of defense that complements traditional AI-based detection models.

A Practical Layer of Protection

The combination of AI and additional layers of defense is crucial as organizations increasingly turn to platformization—standardizing their cybersecurity tools on platforms like Microsoft. With Microsoft’s E5 licensing, for example, companies can streamline their cybersecurity operations, integrating AI and analytics directly into their operating systems.

However, even with these “easy button” solutions, there is still a need for strategies that go beyond standard defenses to mitigate the risks of AI failure.

By adopting AMTD and other adaptive mechanisms, companies can build a robust security posture that doesn’t rely solely on AI but uses it as part of a larger, multi-layered strategy.

AI has been transforming cybersecurity since 2012, initially through behavioral analytics to detect anomalies like unusual logins or data transfers. Over time, its role expanded to advanced machine learning and deep learning, enabling predictive threat detection and automated defense mechanisms. Today, over 80% of cybersecurity vendors incorporate AI, leveraging tools like generative AI to stay ahead of an ever-evolving threat landscape.

AI vs. AI—The Cybersecurity Arms Race:
The battle between attackers and defenders has evolved into a high-stakes ""Machine vs. Machine"" contest. While defenders use AI to automate threat detection and responses, attackers deploy AI-driven tools to exploit vulnerabilities. This rapid escalation underscores the need for resilient and adaptive AI models to counter increasingly sophisticated threats.

AI’s Risks: Lack of Guardrails:
Despite its potential, AI carries significant risks. Without proper safeguards or ""guardrails,"" these systems are vulnerable to manipulation, such as adversarial attacks that trick models into making erroneous decisions. The rush to implement AI solutions often prioritizes speed and profitability over security, increasing the potential for vulnerabilities.

Beyond AI: Defense in Depth Strategies:
AI alone is not a silver bullet for cybersecurity. Complementary strategies like Automated Moving Target Defense (AMTD) provide additional layers of security by constantly shifting the attack surface, making it more challenging for adversaries to gain a foothold. These methods enhance resilience, especially when combined with platform-based tools like Microsoft’s E5, which integrate AI and analytics into a unified security framework.

Final Thoughts:
Organizations should adopt a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity, leveraging AI while also implementing adaptive mechanisms like AMTD to mitigate risks.

httpswikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security,"Cybersecurity, also known as computer security or IT security, involves protecting software, systems, and networks from unauthorized access, data theft, and disruption of services. It has gained critical importance due to the proliferation of connected devices and the growing complexity of information systems. Vulnerabilities, often documented in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database, are exploited by malicious actors using tools like malware, ransomware, phishing, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. These attacks can target individuals, small and medium businesses, or large enterprises, with techniques ranging from backdoors and eavesdropping to privilege escalation and side-channel attacks. Organizations are also challenged by internal threats, social engineering, and spoofing. Countermeasures, including encryption, secure design principles, and robust security architecture, aim to mitigate these threats. Developing a strong information security culture and continuously adapting to evolving threats remain essential for resilience against cyberattacks.
The cybersecurity landscape encompasses preventive, detective, and responsive measures to combat cyberattacks. Key elements include firewalls (software-based or physical), vulnerability management tools, and advanced methods like big data analytics for detecting persistent threats. The CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) forms the foundation of information security, supported by administrative, physical, and technical measures. Techniques like penetration testing, secure coding, and two-factor authentication strengthen defenses. End-user training and cyber hygiene are vital for mitigating human errors, which account for most security breaches. Notable threats target financial institutions, healthcare providers, and critical infrastructure, exploiting systems for financial gain or disruption. Emerging technologies, including IoT devices, smart vehicles, and biometric systems, introduce new vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks range from data breaches to systemic disruptions, exemplified by high-profile incidents affecting corporations, governments, and industries reliant on digital systems.

httpsgridinsoftcomadware,"Adware is part of software that makes money for its creators by bombarding you with ads. Adware sneaks onto computer unnoticed, sometimes bundled with free software or via torrents. Once installed, it floods computer screen with ads. These can be annoying popups, intrusive banners, or intext links that appear out of context. You may be interested in taking a look at our other antivirus tools Trojan Killer, and Online Virus Scanner. September , Adware is a type of unwanted software designed to forcefully display advertisements. To achieve this, the program makes various alterations to your system, primarily targeting web browsers and networking settings. Adware installs itself onto your PC, hoping you'll accidentally or not click on an advert it displays. The main reason why adware exists is to make money but not for you. Adware creators and distributing vendors make money from third parties via either Adware can also track your search and browsing history to display ads that are more relevant to you. Once the adware developer has your location and browser history, they can make an additional profit by selling your information to third parties. Still, relevant and safe advertisements are not the main concern of adware masters. Developers who manage adware make their money like any other advertisers. Two main differences between adware distributors and legit promoters are the people who order these ads and how those banners are paid. Usually, promoters are paid for each click on their advertisement. Meanwhile, fraudsters take contracts for pay per view ads. The price for each visitor is minimal, but when you show it forcibly to hundreds or even thousands victims, there is nothing complicated in making a lot of money. The difference in a character is much easier to understand. Will the legit company advertise itself with illegal marketing tricks Likely no. Hence, all ads adware forces you to see has malicious content to certain extent. Usually, those contents are links that redirect you to unknown and likely unwanted sites. In some cases, the downloading may start after clicking those ads. And only fraudsters know what the program is downloading. You may get a coin miner, another adware, a browser hijacker, the list goes on and on. Regardless of the exact type of malware, it is always an unwanted consequence. Adware comes in different forms. Here are some common types Some types of adware are illegal in the U.S. Lets look more closely at state and federal laws. Many U.S. states have laws against spyware, which includes certain kinds of adware. For example, California's Consumer Protection Against Computer Spyware Act says that a person or business cannot knowingly install software on someone's computer without permission. That in fact covers all the unwanted programs, with ad supported ones among them. Under federal law, causing damage to or more computers within a year, resulting in losses of , or more, is a felony. Adware can cause such damage as the result of showing adverts with malicious content, specifically when the user have clicked one and installed malicious or otherwise destructive program. Adware is one of the most widespread types of malware. You can get it in about a dozen ways from installing a free app from the Web to clicking banners on some dodgy sites. You may discover that your system is infected even after using some PP applications, like uTorrent. Every day, fraudsters discover more unobvious ways to get into your computer. And there is no reason for you to feel guilty almost everyone sometimes needs to use questionable programs. And adware is not so dangerous if you remove it in time. Adware is not very dangerous itself. It makes only minor changes to the system to facilitate its activity. However, if you remove it inappropriately and will not fix those changes, you will likely spectate various bugs in your web browser. Some problems may also appear in various apps with web interface because of the modified networking settings. Among the main changes it does are modifications to HOSTS file. It plays a role in controlling networking in Windows. Situated in the system partition, it contains information about the DNS servers necessary for connecting to the desired server. Typically, pages utilized by adware to showcase ads are internally protected to prevent them from being blocked by web browsers. When adware manipulates your HOSTS, the PC connects to a specific DNS address on the adware server, avoiding any blockages for connections. Browser settings may undergo changes for various reasons. Viruses can modify your homepage to accommodate multiple advertisements. Another possible alteration is the restriction of your settings window, particularly prevalent when adware is distributed as a browser plugin. This tactic hinders a straightforward browser reset, which is often an effective method for eliminating unwanted behavior. Many more problems may be addressed by adware advertisements. No legit companies will agree to an advertising contract with adware distributors, as you read. Hence, each ad can contain something malicious, and you never know which one and how dangerous this something is. Potentially unwanted programs, together with browser hijackers, will not make your files encrypted, like ransomware, for example. Still, it will bring chaos to your PC. Meanwhile, the Coin Miner Malware activity will make your system impossible to use and may even lead to hardware failures. Since the essence of adware is to throw advertisement banners at you, your devices infection with the disputed pest will not pass unnoticed. Such a penetration into your system would be the black advertisers complete failure if you didn't notice the adware's presence at all. Here we list the recognizable signs of your device having adware and requiring a quick remedy. Even if you're careful, you might still download adware by accident. Here's how to remove it from your device. Safari is the default browser on iPhones, iPads, and Macs. To get rid of adware in Safari Chrome is Googles browser and can be used on Android devices. To remove problematic apps from Chrome on your Android To protect your Android from bad apps To stop notifications from certain websites To remove adware from Chrome on your Windows computer To clean up Chrome adware on your Mac, Chromebook, or Linux device On iPhones and iPads, you might not need antivirus software, but if popups are bothering you, here's how to block them To remove adware from Firefox, you can reset it or remove the malicious toolbar. To reset Firefox to factory defaults To remove the malicious toolbar Not all adware is malware. Some of it is packaged with legitimate software, and many new computers come with various adware installed. If you get a new PC, you can check the list of installed programs in the settings to see if any unwanted software accompanies the computer. If your PC is new, another strategy is to reset it to a fresh installation of Windows. By resetting the computer to factory conditions, it can remove all third-party apps, including any installed adware. If you acquire adware on an existing computer, you can manually uninstall it using Add or Remove Programs in Settings, but only if you can definitively identify which program on your PC is the cause of the spyware. If you cant, then you might want to install our antimalware. This antivirus tool is adept at identifying and removing adware spyware. The best approach, of course, is prevention avoiding getting infected with spyware, to begin with. So here are some easy steps you can take to avoid getting spyware on your PC Download Adware Remover","Adware and Its Role in Cybersecurity Threats
Adware is a type of malware that forces users to view unwanted advertisements, often causing severe disruptions to user experience and posing significant privacy risks. It operates by making unauthorized changes to system and browser settings, frequently installing as a Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP) or browser hijacker. Beyond mere annoyance, adware can compromise user privacy by tracking browsing habits and personal data, which are often sold to third parties.

Notable adware examples include Fireball, which hijacks browsers for generating fraudulent ad revenue, and Gator, which monitors online behavior to deliver targeted ads. In severe cases, adware can download additional malware, including coin miners and spyware, exacerbating the risk to the infected system.

Legal and Technical Challenges in Combating Adware
Legally, adware straddles a fine line between nuisance and criminal activity. Federal and state laws in the U.S., such as California's Consumer Protection Against Computer Spyware Act, prohibit unauthorized software installations. However, enforcement remains challenging, particularly when adware operates under the guise of legitimate advertising-supported software.

From a technical perspective, adware often modifies critical files like the HOSTS file to redirect web traffic through malicious DNS servers, bypassing browser security features. This tactic not only ensures the uninterrupted display of ads but also makes the system vulnerable to phishing and other cyber threats.

Preventative Measures and Removal Strategies
To mitigate the risks posed by adware, users are advised to adopt a multi-faceted approach, including the use of robust anti-malware tools and maintaining up-to-date software. Additionally, exercising caution when downloading free software or clicking on unfamiliar links is crucial. Infected systems require thorough cleaning, which may involve resetting browser settings, removing suspicious extensions, or using specialized adware removal tools.

Conclusion
Adware represents a persistent cybersecurity threat that, while often dismissed as a minor nuisance, can lead to significant privacy breaches and system vulnerabilities. Effective countermeasures include both preventative strategies and rigorous post-infection protocols to safeguard personal and corporate data.","1. What is adware?

httpsintel471comglossary,"Cybersecurity and cyberattacks are advancing at an unprecedented pace, with new threats and tactics continuously emerging. Cyber Human Intelligence (HUMINT) represents a fusion of traditional intelligence and digital methodologies, enabling organizations to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen their defense strategies. This approach underscores the importance of understanding the ever-changing threat landscape to stay ahead of malicious actors.
 
 Malware remains a significant concern, with various types posing unique challenges. Data theft malware targets sensitive financial or login credentials, while clipboard hijackers alter cryptocurrency transactions by replacing wallet addresses. Crypto-mining malware exploits devices' resources without authorization, and ransomware locks users out of their systems or data until a ransom is paid. Additionally, droppers are used to deliver and install malicious payloads on compromised systems, facilitating further breaches.
 
 Network-based attacks and vulnerabilities also pose substantial risks. Botnets, networks of compromised devices, are used for large-scale malicious activities, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Bulletproof hosting providers enable cybercriminals to operate with minimal risk of law enforcement intervention by hosting malware or phishing sites. Threat actors also employ lateral movement tactics, navigating through networks with compromised credentials or remote access tools to achieve their objectives stealthily.
 
 Identity theft and financial fraud are other critical areas of concern. Cybercriminals exploit stolen data through breaches or phishing to gain unauthorized access to accounts or systems. Payment card fraud targets point-of-sale systems and online transactions to harvest sensitive financial information. These schemes continue to evolve, driven by increasingly sophisticated tools and techniques.
 
 Emerging threats highlight the growing complexity of the cyber threat landscape. Loader Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS), such as AresLoader linked to Russian hacktivism, allows attackers to deploy malware effortlessly. Advanced DNS techniques hide phishing and malware sites by utilizing constantly changing host networks. Supply chain attacks exploit vulnerabilities in third-party relationships, posing a significant challenge for organizational security.
 
 To counter these threats, organizations are employing a mix of advanced technologies and robust strategies. Penetration testing is widely used to simulate attacks and identify system vulnerabilities. Incident response plans prepare organizations to respond effectively to security breaches, while risk management helps mitigate vulnerabilities proactively. Resilience-building initiatives focus on enhancing the ability to withstand and recover from cyberattacks, ensuring long-term security.
 
 As cyber threats grow in sophistication and scope, adopting a comprehensive approach that integrates intelligence, proactive measures, and emerging technologies is crucial. This layered defense strategy ensures organizations can effectively navigate the complexities of modern cybersecurity","Cybersecurity is evolving rapidly as new threats and attack tactics emerge continuously. One critical strategy to counter these threats is Cyber Human Intelligence (HUMINT), which blends traditional intelligence methods with digital tools to uncover vulnerabilities and improve defense strategies. Staying ahead of cybercriminals requires understanding this constantly shifting threat landscape.

Malware remains a primary concern in cybersecurity. Types of malware include:

Data theft malware, which steals financial or login credentials.

There is no automated penetration testing which requires the use of tools, sometimes a lot of tools. But it also requires an extremely experienced person to conduct penetration testing. A good penetration tester always at some point during their testing craft a script, change parameters of an attack or tweak settings of the tools he or she may be using. It could be at application or network level but specific to a function, department or number of assets. One can include the whole infrastructure and all applications but that is impractical in the real world because of cost and time. You define your scope on a number of factors that are mainly based on risk and how important is an asset. Some of the penetration tester Spends a lot of money on low risk assets which may take a number of days to exploit is not practical. Penetration testing requires high skilled knowledge and that's why it is costly. Testers often exploit a new vulnerability or discover vulnerabilities that are not known to normal business processes. Penetration testing normally can take from days to a few weeks, it is often conducted once a year and reports are short and to the point. It does have a higher than average chance of causing outages. On the other hand, vulnerability scanning is the act of identifying potential vulnerabilities in network devices such as firewalls, routers, switches, servers and applications. It is automated and focuses on finding potential and know vulnerabilities on the network or an application level. It does not exploit the vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanners only identify potential vulnerabilities they do not exploit the vulnerabilities. Hence, they are not built to find zero day exploits. The scope of vulnerability scanning is business wide, requiring automated tools to manage a high number of assets. It is wider in scope than penetration testing. Products specific knowledge is needed to effectively use the vulnerability scans product. It is usually run by administrators or security personnel with good networking knowledge. Vulnerability scans can be run frequently on any number of assets to ascertain known vulnerabilities are detected and patched. Thus, you can eliminate more serious vulnerabilities for your valuable resources quickly. An effective way to remediate vulnerabilities is to follow the vulnerability management lifecycle. The cost of a vulnerability scan is low to moderate as compared to penetration testing, and it is a detective control as opposed to preventive like penetration testing. Vulnerability management can be fed into patch management for effective patching. Patches must be tested on a test system before rolling out to production. Businesses must manually check each vulnerability before testing again Does not confirm that a vulnerability is exploitable See Also Picking Your Vulnerability Scanner The Questions You Should Ask Both tests work together to encourage optimal network and application security. Vulnerability scans are great weekly, monthly, or quarterly insight into your network security the quick Xray, while penetration tests are a very thorough way to deeply examine your network security the periodic detailed MRI. Yes, penetration tests are expensive, but you are paying a professional to examine every nook and cranny of your business the way a real world attacker would, to find a possibility of compromise. Originally published at httpscybrsecurty.blogspot.com. ","Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning are both essential components of a robust cybersecurity strategy, though they serve different purposes and have distinct methodologies. Penetration testing is a targeted, manual process conducted by highly skilled professionals who use various tools, scripts, and attack techniques to identify vulnerabilities. Unlike automated tools, penetration testers customize their approach to the specific assets and risks of an organization, often uncovering new or previously unknown vulnerabilities. This testing, which can take days or weeks, is typically done annually and may cause outages. It is a high-cost, high-skill activity focused on identifying critical risks and mimicking real-world attack strategies to test a network's defenses.

In contrast, vulnerability scanning is an automated process that identifies known vulnerabilities in network devices, servers, applications, and other infrastructure components. It does not exploit vulnerabilities but simply flags potential weaknesses, making it a valuable tool for detecting and managing risks on a broader scale. Vulnerability scans are typically run more frequently—such as weekly or monthly—and are used to quickly identify and patch known issues. While the cost of vulnerability scanning is lower than penetration testing, it does not provide the same depth of insight or confirm whether a vulnerability is exploitable. These scans are often used as part of a vulnerability management lifecycle, which feeds into patch management processes to ensure timely remediation of known vulnerabilities.

Both methods complement each other, with vulnerability scans offering a quick overview of a network's security posture and penetration testing providing a more thorough examination. By combining the two, organizations can gain a comprehensive understanding of their security vulnerabilities and better defend against cyberattacks.","1. What is the scope of penetration testing?

httpssecurelistcomksb-financial-and-crimeware-predictions-2025114565,"Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team constantly monitors known and emerging cyberthreats directed at the financial industry, with banks and fintech companies being the most targeted. We also closely follow threats that aim to infiltrate a wider range of industries, namely ransomware families that are financially motivated.

These observations, as part of our Kaspersky Security Bulletin, help us devise predictions about how the financial cyberthreat landscape will change over the year. This report outlines notable attack trends we expect to face, to help businesses and individuals protect from them. Let’s first look into our predictions for 2024 to see how they turned out, explore the key events in the financial cyberthreat landscape during the year, and then try to predict the trends for 2025.

Increase in AI-powered cyberattacks ✅ True The prediction that anticipated an upsurge in cyberattacks leveraging machine learning tools turned out to be true. In 2024, we saw cyberattacks boosted by AI emerge not only through emails, manipulated ads, phishing attacks (approximately 21% of phishing emails are now generated by AI) and other content, but also as an effective way to bypass biometric authentication. Machine learning tools allowed criminals to open new accounts using leaked data, impersonating the victims and bypassing security mechanisms used in the KYC (know-your-customer) process, manipulating and changing faces, videos, pictures, etc. Threat actors like Gringo 171 specialized in developing these tools, selling them to any criminal interested in bypassing biometrics authentication. As an example, in one recent case, Brazilian Federal Police arrested criminals who were using AI-powered tools to open bank accounts for money laundering. They opened thousands of accounts, creating fake faces and easily bypassing biometric checking.

Fraudulent schemes targeting direct payment systems ✅ True The prediction that cybercriminals would exploit direct payment systems like PIX, FedNow and UPI through clippers and mobile banking Trojans was confirmed. We saw the appearance of GoPIX, a banking Trojan in Brazil targeting the PIX real-time payment system and implementing clipboard monitoring as a way of changing keys and stealing payments. The same technique was used in a Trojan targeting Android devices. Other banking Trojan families already implemented cryptocurrency stealing functionality by targeting the sites directly, or intercepting user clipboard. While there haven’t been any major publicly reported fraud cases directly tied to the FedNow system as of October 2024, concerns about the potential for fraud remain high. FedNow, the Federal Reserve’s real-time payment service, allows for instant fund transfers, but its rapid nature can be exploited by fraudsters, especially in the form of authorized push payment (APP) fraud. Regarding UPI, the national direct payment system of India, scammers spammed UPI IDs with multiple collect requests. It’s easy to crack a UPI ID as it is generally formed with the user’s mobile number followed by the UPI provider name. Scammers can obtain victims’ phone numbers, as they are widely used in public — for online shopping, in malls, restaurants and so on. Users have been getting many fraudulent money collect and autopay requests from Netflix, Google Pay, etc. in their UPI accounts. In some cases, these are authentic UPI autopay requests initiated by fraudsters from their Netflix accounts, making an unsuspecting user essentially pay for the scammer’s subscription. Finally, we have noticed a rise in fake instant payment apps in Latin America, used to carry out different kinds of scams. In this context, cybercriminal groups are developing apps that convincingly mimic monetary transactions, displaying a fake receipt without any real connection to transactional systems, to trick sellers into engaging in illegal or loss-making transactions. These apps are sold on dark web forums to scammers who use them to make fake purchases on behalf of small businesses.

Global adoption of Automated Transfer Systems (ATS) ☑️ Partially true The prediction suggested that attacks with mobile ATS will become adopted globally. While mobile banking Trojans using ATS were already a reality, their global adoption is still underway. One of the groups behind the development of a particular malware family using this technique in Brazil was planning to expand their attacks to Europe by launching a test version of the malware. However, before they had a chance to spread out, they were arrested following a Kaspersky notification to the Brazilian police. Moreover, with Google continuing to restrict even further the Accessibility permission in newer Android versions, we believe it will be harder for malware in general to apply the ATS trick in future mobile banking Trojan developments, as this needs accessibility settings enabled.

Resurgence of the Brazilian banking Trojans ✅ True The prediction that attacks by the Brazilian banking Trojans would become more extensive, and Grandoreiro would gain momentum was confirmed. The Brazilian banking Trojans arose in 2024 as a global threat, targeting many countries and expanding their reach. The most prevalent families in 2024 have been Guildma, Javali, Melcoz, Grandoreiro (the Tetrade group). Other families are Banbra, BestaFera, Bizarro, ChePro, Casbaneiro, Ponteiro, and Coyote. Grandoreiro expanded to target more than 1700 banks in 45 countries, on every continent, and even the arrest of several gang members didn’t stop them. In the top 30 banking Trojan families we detected worldwide, 11 are of Brazilian origin and account for 22% of all detections on our users in 2024 (according to the KSN statistics gathered from January to October 2024).

Ransomware target selection ✅ True The prediction suggested that ransomware groups would turn to more targeted, highly selective attacks. In 2024, ransomware groups have intensified their focus on high-value targets, with larger organizations, particularly those whose revenue exceeds $5 billion, continuing to be the primary marks due to a likelihood of extracting higher ransoms from these. This trend aligns with a shift toward targeting of financial services and especially banking institutions, there being a marked increase in attacks. Banks alone accounted for 20% of ransomware incidents in this sector. The average ransom demand rose by $400,000 from 2023 to 2024, underscoring attackers’ pursuit of higher payouts. However, while the most skillful ransomware operators have homed in on high-profile sectors, other groups continue to strike broadly, impacting the government, healthcare, and education sectors. This dual approach drove a 21.5% rise in ransomware incidents from Q1 to Q2 2024 and a year-over-year increase of 4.3% in the first half of the year, suggesting that, despite a selective trend, ransomware still remains a widespread threat across industries.

Open-source backdoored packages ✅ True The prediction anticipated a worrying increase in open-source backdoor packages, which we observed to be true. The XZ Backdoor was a major incident affecting Linux distributions when backdoored packages ended up inside popular OSS. We did an extensive analysis of this backdoor here, here and here. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the only one, as we saw many other similar incidents this year.

Decrease in 0-days, increase in 1-day exploits ❌ False The prediction that crimeware actors would shift from zero-day to first-day exploits has proven inaccurate for 2024, as recent trends indicate a sustained and even heightened reliance on zero-day vulnerabilities. According to CVE.org, it registered 28,961 vulnerabilities in their catalog in 2023, while January through November 2024, the program registered 29,004, the highest number ever recorded. According to the Rapid7 2024 Attack Intelligence Report, the use of zero-day exploits has surged, with 53% of widely exploited CVEs recently beginning as zero-day attacks — a trend observed in two of the last three years. This focus on zero-days has been reinforced by the sophisticated and orchestrated nature of recent attacks, where 23% of widespread threat CVEs have been attributed to high-value zero-day vulnerabilities. The commercial market for zero-day exploits is also booming, with brokers offering significant payouts, such as up to $2 million for iPhone zero-days. In contrast, there is no evidence pointing to a rise in first-day exploit usage among crimeware actors, underlining that zero-day attacks remain a primary tactic in the cybersecurity threat landscape.

Exploitation of misconfigured devices and services ✅ True The prediction regarding the exploitation of misconfigured devices and services has proved accurate in 2024, as evidenced by the EMERALDWHALE operation. This global campaign specifically targeted misconfigured Git setups, resulting in the theft of over 15,000 cloud service credentials and unauthorized access to more than 10,000 private repositories. The impact was extensive, compromising various services, including cloud providers and email platforms, which underscores the widespread nature of vulnerabilities relating by misconfiguration. Attackers used private, automated tools to scan, extract, and verify stolen tokens from misconfigured services, significantly expanding their reach and efficiency. This misconfiguration trend also exposed sensitive data stored in configuration files, such as Laravel’s .env files, and highlighted cloud storage vulnerabilities, such as a compromised Amazon S3 bucket containing over a terabyte of sensitive information.

Fluid composition of affiliate groups ✅ True The prediction suggesting a more fluid distinction between cybercrime groups has proven accurate. In 2024, the ransomware ecosystem has become increasingly dynamic and adaptable, with affiliates adopting a “multi-platform” approach. Many threat actors are now working with multiple ransomware families simultaneously, allowing them to optimize their operations and mitigate risks associated with relying on a single group. For instance, cybersecurity researchers have observed affiliates actively participating in campaigns for different ransomware families, switching between groups like BlackMatter, and newly emerged ones, such as RansomHub. This strategic approach allows them to maintain a constant stream of attacks by leveraging different ransomware strains depending on the target, potential payout, and current operational status of each RaaS platform. The fragmentation of the ransomware landscape is evident, with the number of groups listing victims rising from 43 to 68 and the emergence of 31 new groups in the past year alone. This decentralization complicates law enforcement efforts, as tracking and containing these groups has become more challenging due to their agile structure and international reach. Smaller groups like Medusa and Cloak are capitalizing on this fluid environment, offering attractive profit-sharing on dark web resources to draw affiliates. For example, Medusa is offering up to 90% profit-sharing to attract affiliates, while Cloak allows affiliates to join without any initial payment. Meanwhile, established platforms continue to evolve their offerings to retain and attract skilled operators.

Adoption of less popular / cross-platform languages ✅ True The prediction anticipated that cybercriminals would turn to lesser-known programming languages to evade detection. Multiple threats have emerged from the adoption of fairly new or non-standard programming languages used for malware development. Tooling like KrustyLoader (a loader implant written in Rust), NKAbuse, or even K4Spreader (a loader used by 8220 Gang and written in Golang) has been caught in the wild. Moreover, we saw Trojan spies, banking Trojans and other financially motivated malware developed in Go. These are a clear signal that malware developers make use of these languages not only because of their practicality and easy portability to different OSs, but also because they make analysis a more strenuous task.","In 2024, cyberattacks targeting the financial sector saw significant shifts in tactics and technologies. One of the most notable trends was the rise of AI-powered cyberattacks, where machine learning tools were leveraged to enhance phishing, manipulate ads, and bypass biometric security systems. Criminals used AI to open accounts using stolen data, impersonating victims and bypassing KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures. For example, Brazilian criminals utilized AI-powered tools to create fake faces and bypass biometric checks to open thousands of bank accounts for money laundering.

Another major threat was fraud targeting direct payment systems such as PIX, FedNow, and UPI. Banking Trojans like GoPIX were specifically designed to exploit these systems by intercepting payment data or altering transaction details using clipboard monitoring. While the FedNow system itself had not experienced major fraud incidents, concerns around its vulnerability, especially related to authorized push payment (APP) fraud, remained high. Similarly, the UPI system in India saw an increase in scams involving fraudulent payment requests and fake apps designed to deceive users and small businesses into engaging in loss-making transactions.

Additionally, ransomware groups increasingly focused on high-value, high-profile targets such as large banks and financial institutions. Ransom demands rose, with banks accounting for a significant portion of ransomware attacks in 2024. Ransomware operators refined their tactics, adopting a more selective targeting strategy while still maintaining attacks across other sectors like government and healthcare. This shift indicated that cybercriminals were shifting their efforts toward sectors with a higher potential for large payouts.

Another concerning development was the exploitation of open-source backdoored packages, with attacks targeting widely used software distributions, especially in Linux environments. This year, backdoors like the XZ Backdoor were found in popular open-source software packages, increasing the risk for developers and organizations relying on these tools. At the same time, the use of zero-day vulnerabilities continued to be a preferred method of attack, with zero-day exploits outpacing first-day exploits in terms of usage by cybercriminals.

The cybersecurity landscape in 2024 also saw a significant rise in misconfigured devices and services being exploited by cybercriminals. One major example was the EMERALDWHALE operation, where attackers targeted misconfigured Git setups to steal cloud service credentials and access private repositories. This campaign underscored the dangers of improper configurations in cloud environments, highlighting the importance of regular security audits and configuration management to prevent unauthorized access.

As cyber threats evolve, the need for robust security measures and continuous monitoring remains critical, particularly for financial institutions that are increasingly targeted by sophisticated, AI-enhanced cyberattacks.","1.

https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer-security,"Artificial intelligence's impact on society, including computer security, is widely debated. Many argue that AI improves the quality of everyday life by doing routine and even complicated tasks better than humans can, making life simpler, safer, and more efficient. Others argue AI poses dangerous privacy risks, exacerbates racism by standardizing people, and costs workers their jobs leading to greater unemployment. For more on the debate over artificial intelligence, visit ProCon.org .

Computer security, also called cybersecurity, is the protection of computer systems and information from harm, theft, and unauthorized use. Computer hardware is typically protected by the same means used to protect other valuable or sensitive equipment—namely, serial numbers, doors and locks, and alarms. The protection of information and system access, on the other hand, is achieved through other tactics, some of them quite complex.

computer security, the protection of computer systems and information from harm, theft, and unauthorized use. Computer hardware is typically protected by the same means used to protect other valuable or sensitive equipment—namely, serial numbers, doors and locks, and alarms. The protection of information and system access, on the other hand, is achieved through other tactics, some of them quite complex.

The security precautions related to computer information and access address four major threats: (1) theft of data, such as that of military secrets from government computers; (2) vandalism, including the destruction of data by a computer virus; (3) fraud, such as employees at a bank channeling funds into their own accounts; and (4) invasion of privacy, such as the illegal accessing of protected personal financial or medical data from a large database. The most basic means of protecting a computer system against theft, vandalism, invasion of privacy, and other irresponsible behaviours is to electronically track and record the access to, and activities of, the various users of a computer system. This is commonly done by assigning an individual password to each person who has access to a system. The computer system itself can then automatically track the use of these passwords, recording such data as which files were accessed under particular passwords and so on. Another security measure is to store a system’s data on a separate device or medium that is normally inaccessible through the computer system. Finally, data is often encrypted so that it can be deciphered only by holders of a singular encryption key. (See data encryption.)

Computer security has become increasingly important since the late 1960s, when modems (devices that allow computers to communicate over telephone lines) were introduced. The proliferation of personal computers in the 1980s compounded the problem because they enabled hackers (irresponsible computerphiles) to illegally access major computer systems from the privacy of their homes. With the tremendous growth of the Internet in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, computer security became a widespread concern. The development of advanced security techniques aims to diminish such threats, though concurrent refinements in the methods of computer crime pose ongoing hazards.","Computer security, or cybersecurity, is essential for protecting computer systems and sensitive information from threats like theft, vandalism, fraud, and invasion of privacy. To safeguard computer hardware, common protective measures include serial numbers, locks, and alarms. However, protecting information and system access involves more complex tactics, such as tracking user access, assigning individual passwords, and encrypting data. Password tracking systems log user activities, including the files accessed under specific passwords, while encryption ensures that data can only be read by authorized users with the correct decryption key.

The introduction of modems in the late 20th century and the rise of personal computers in the 1990s increased the vulnerability of systems to unauthorized access, particularly through hackers. With the growth of the Internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s, cybersecurity became a widespread concern, as it enabled malicious actors to illegally access systems remotely. As a result, there has been a continuous effort to develop advanced security techniques to combat cyber threats, although the sophistication of cybercrimes has also evolved, creating ongoing risks. 

Key threats to computer security include data theft (e.g., stealing military secrets), vandalism (such as viruses destroying data), fraud (e.g., embezzlement), and privacy breaches (e.g., illegal access to financial or medical data). These risks highlight the importance of cybersecurity practices, including secure user authentication and data encryption, to protect systems and information.","1.

httpswwwbritannicacomtopiccyberattack,"cyberattack, deliberate and malicious attempt to gain unauthorized access to a digital system. Cyberattacks can affect computers, smartphones, or other Internet-connected devices. Cybercriminals main goal is often to steal money, personal information, credentials, intellectual property, or otherwise valuable information. Attackers may also aim to disrupt or cripple the targeted system. Cyberattacks are often a precursor to more serious cybercrime, such as identity theft, invasion of privacy, and fraud. Such attacks occur every day, and more than half of them result in damages of , or more each. The average cost of a data breach is . million, and some estimates indicate that cybercrime will cost the world . trillion annually by . The most advanced cyberattacks have disrupted industrial machinery, transportation, and Internet service to entire regions they have even left hundreds of thousands of people without electricity. Cyberattacks present a significant threat to computer systems not only because of the damage they can cause but also because of their low cost of entry. With mastery over certain software, one person could launch an attack against an entire country. Moreover, attackers can easily hide their identity, location, and motive. Cyber defense measures must repeatedly deter attacks that may differ in scope and method, whereas a cyberattack needs to succeed only once an unprotected server can face hundreds of attacks a day. The line between cyber defense and cyberattack, however, sometimes blurs. For example, Pegasus spyware was explicitly designed for national security and law enforcement but was used to track and monitor influential individuals without their knowledge. Both individuals and organizations can perpetrate cyberattacks, but such attacks differ from cyberwar, which is typically waged between countries. Cyberwar can include physical attacks against digital infrastructure such as destroying communications systems or hardware in addition to cyberattacks. Cyberattacks target a systems syntactic layer, its semantic layer, or both. Syntactic cyberattacks center on software and, in most cases, involve malware a portmanteau of malicious and software. Semantic cyberattacks attempt to trick victims into providing valuable information or access to valuable systems, using a strategy known as social engineering. A common example of social engineering is phishing the practice of sending fraudulent emails that impersonate trustworthy contacts to ask for personal information. Cyberattacks generally operate in four broad phases. Attackers start with reconnaissance, during which they probe for weaknesses and gather information within a targets system. They may use social engineering to obtain private information and may consider aligned targets, such as partners, customers, or suppliers. During this stage, the attackers typically research how to breach the system and whether that will require creating or buying malware or conducting trials. The second phase is delivery, during which the attackers implement a plan to infiltrate the target. Common methods include using an infected USB, creating a fake website, or planting a link within an email. Attackers may even resort to more traditional forms of crime, such as bribery or blackmail. The third phase of a cyberattack is breaching. If the infiltration plan succeeds, the attackers gain access to the targets system and establish a digital presence. The fourth phase is the attack. Now that the attackers have gained access to their targets system, they may attempt to breach more valuable networks or to establish a more permanent presence. They may also attempt to disable system security measures. The attackers can then proceed with their plans depending on the target, they may be interested in sending bank payments, disrupting or crippling business operations, stealing intellectual property or sensitive information, or otherwise changing the network. They can disrupt the system to gain remote control over it, perhaps even connecting it to other compromised devices. Advanced attackers typically vacate the system and remove evidence of their presence after they have achieved their goals they may even disguise their work as someone elses. In some cases, they leave behind a back door for future access or to sell access to other cybercriminals. Some attackers, however, wreak havoc merely to attract attention to their success. Cyberattacks can be classified into two categories untargeted and targeted. Untargeted attacks aim to affect as many devices or services as possible. For example, infiltrators sometimes use water holing, in which a web page is created or compromised and visitors are then attacked as they access the page. Another example is scanning, in which attackers systematically attempt to find vulnerabilities in a system, often aiming for points of entry. Targeted cyberattacks are tailored to a specific individual or organization. The culprit is often external, but internal actors can also compromise a system. Malware is an umbrella term for software programs used in cyberattacks, typically installed on victims devices when they interact with a dangerous link or email. For example, electronic games or applications from a third-party service may hide malware within their software packages. Attackers may also try baiting, a strategy in which malware is left in a public online space, such as a web page. Malware includes viruses, worms, Trojans, rootkits, spyware, and adware. Scareware uses false alerts to pressure a user into downloading further malware or into providing valuable information. Ransomware, also called crypto viral extortion, blocks access to a digital asset or device until the owner pays a ransom. Payments have been as much as million. Ransomware is the second most common form of cyberattack in fact, there are organizations that sell ransomware attacks as a service, enabling others to conduct such attacks. Software exists to detect and combat malware, and operating systems are continually updated to minimize weaknesses. However, malware has advanced just as quickly as cyber defense strategies and tools. Phishing is a common social engineering tactic in which cyber  attackers impersonate trusted sources, typically via email, to steal valuable data or to install malware. Spear phishing is the term for sending such emails to specific targets in an organization whale phishing is a subcategory that targets company executives. Business email compromise scams occur when cybercriminals impersonate an executive or a business associate and ask that money be wired to a specific account. A denial of service DoS attack overwhelms its target with traffic and thus prevents legitimate use. Distributed denial of service DDoS attacks occur when the source of the traffic is not a single entity but many, typically involving the use of a botnet. A botnet is a network of connected devices termed zombie computers that are all infected with malware, allowing attackers to use them for their own purposes without owner authorization. The largest discovered botnet comprised nearly two million computers. Man in the middle MitM attacks, sometimes called eavesdropping attacks, occur when attackers intercept communications either between people or between an individual and a server. Unsecured public networks provide a relatively easy environment for attackers to spy on and intercept Internet traffic. Session hijacking attacks are a subcategory of MitM attacks in which attackers match their IP address to that of a legitimate user, thereby gaining the same level of access on the users server. Simply ensuring that all software is up to date and avoiding unknown links can be an effective strategy to prevent cyberattacks. Identity and access management strategies, such as multifactor authentication, strong passwords, and virtual private networks VPNs, provide added levels of security. Firewalls and Internet encryption can prevent bad actors from interacting with a network. Additionally, data loss prevention tools can monitor security threats and aid in backing up important data in the event of a breach. Organizations can work to deter cyberattacks by educating employees on cybersecurity tips, enlisting third-party security experts, or investing in an internal cybersecurity team. Such teams can take measures to root out system weaknesses, detect cyberattacks, and create response plans in the aftermath of an attack. Although it is impossible to be completely secure from cyberattacks, such measures can help to lessen potential damage.","Pegasus spyware has been widely discussed due to its dual-use nature, marketed as a tool for enhancing national security but subsequently used for unlawful surveillance of journalists, political figures, and human rights activists. This spyware’s ability to infiltrate devices without detection raises significant ethical concerns, especially regarding privacy rights and the potential misuse of such powerful surveillance technology. Initially intended to assist in counterterrorism efforts, its deployment by authoritarian regimes to monitor and silence opposition blurs the line between legitimate cybersecurity measures and cyberattacks, exposing the fine balance between defense and abuse in the digital age.

Cyberattacks, in general, represent a significant threat to the integrity of digital systems and information. These deliberate and malicious efforts often aim to steal sensitive data, cause disruption, or damage a target’s infrastructure. The most common cyberattacks are financially motivated, with criminals targeting individuals or organizations to steal money, intellectual property, or credentials. Additionally, more destructive forms of cyberattacks can disable essential systems, such as industrial machinery, public services, and even power grids. The motivations behind cyberattacks vary widely, but their ultimate goal is often to exploit vulnerabilities in digital systems for personal gain or to exert control over critical infrastructure.

The stages of a cyberattack typically unfold in phases, beginning with reconnaissance, where attackers gather intelligence about their target’s system and look for weak points to exploit. Next comes delivery, where the attacker executes their plan to breach the system, often using phishing emails, infected USB drives, or malicious websites to gain access. Once inside, the attacker establishes a presence in the system during the breaching phase, which sets the stage for the final phase: the attack itself. In this stage, attackers may exfiltrate sensitive data, install malicious software, or disrupt system operations, depending on their objectives. These phases are designed to be stealthy, with the attacker aiming to avoid detection while maximizing the damage to the system.

Malware plays a significant role in cyberattacks, encompassing a wide range of harmful software designed to infiltrate and damage systems. This category includes viruses, worms, and ransomware, which are all capable of crippling digital environments. Ransomware, in particular, has seen a surge in popularity, with cybercriminals locking systems or data and demanding large sums of money for their release. Phishing, another common attack method, relies on social engineering tactics to trick users into revealing personal information or clicking on malicious links. This form of deception has become more sophisticated, with attackers tailoring their messages to specific targets, a practice known as spear-phishing. Meanwhile, Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks are designed to interrupt or intercept communication systems, further highlighting the diverse and ever-evolving nature of cyber threats.

In this landscape, cybersecurity measures must be dynamic, continuously adapting to the latest threats. The line between defense and offense becomes blurred, as shown with tools like Pegasus spyware, which exemplifies how surveillance technology initially developed for security can be misused, turning into a form of cyberattack itself. This complexity underscores the challenges organizations and governments face in safeguarding against an ever-growing array of cyber threats.","1. What is a cyberattack?

Because of the early and widespread adoption of computers and the Internet in the United States , most of the earliest victims and villains of cybercrime were Americans. By the 21st century, though, hardly a hamlet remained anywhere in the world that had not been touched by cybercrime of one sort or another.

cybercrime , the use of a computer as an instrument to further illegal ends, such as committing fraud , trafficking in child pornography and intellectual property, stealing identities , or violating privacy. Cybercrime, especially through the Internet , has grown in importance as the computer has become central to commerce, entertainment, and government.

Defining cybercrime

New technologies create new criminal opportunities but few new types of crime. What distinguishes cybercrime from traditional criminal activity? Obviously, one difference is the use of the digital computer, but technology alone is insufficient for any distinction that might exist between different realms of criminal activity. Criminals do not need a computer to commit fraud, traffic in child pornography and intellectual property, steal an identity, or violate someone’s privacy. All those activities existed before the “cyber” prefix became ubiquitous. Cybercrime, especially involving the Internet, represents an extension of existing criminal behaviour alongside some novel illegal activities.

Most cybercrime is an attack on information about individuals, corporations, or governments. Although the attacks do not take place on a physical body, they do take place on the personal or corporate virtual body, which is the set of informational attributes that define people and institutions on the Internet. In other words, in the digital age our virtual identities are essential elements of everyday life: we are a bundle of numbers and identifiers in multiple computer databases owned by governments and corporations. Cybercrime highlights the centrality of networked computers in our lives, as well as the fragility of such seemingly solid facts as individual identity.

An important aspect of cybercrime is its nonlocal character: actions can occur in jurisdictions separated by vast distances. This poses severe problems for law enforcement since previously local or even national crimes now require international cooperation. For example, if a person accesses child pornography located on a computer in a country that does not ban child pornography, is that individual committing a crime in a nation where such materials are illegal? Where exactly does cybercrime take place? Cyberspace is simply a richer version of the space where a telephone conversation takes place, somewhere between the two people having the conversation. As a planet-spanning network, the Internet offers criminals multiple hiding places in the real world as well as in the network itself. However, just as individuals walking on the ground leave marks that a skilled tracker can follow, cybercriminals leave clues as to their identity and location, despite their best efforts to cover their tracks. In order to follow such clues across national boundaries, though, international cybercrime treaties must be ratified.

In 1996 the Council of Europe, together with government representatives from the United States, Canada, and Japan, drafted a preliminary international treaty covering computer crime. Around the world, civil libertarian groups immediately protested provisions in the treaty requiring Internet service providers (ISPs) to store information on their customers’ transactions and to turn this information over on demand. Work on the treaty proceeded nevertheless, and on November 23, 2001, the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime was signed by 30 states. The convention came into effect in 2004. Additional protocols, covering terrorist activities and racist and xenophobic cybercrimes, were proposed in 2002 and came into effect in 2006. In addition, various national laws, such as the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, have expanded law enforcement’s power to monitor and protect computer networks.","Cybercrime refers to the use of computers to commit illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, trafficking in child pornography, intellectual property theft, and violations of privacy. As the Internet became central to commerce, entertainment, and government in the 21st century, cybercrime grew in scope and scale, affecting individuals, corporations, and governments worldwide. While many activities associated with cybercrime, such as fraud and privacy violations, existed before the rise of digital technologies, cybercrime now represents an extension of these behaviors in the online space, targeting virtual identities and the information that defines individuals and organizations on the Internet.

A significant feature of cybercrime is its nonlocal nature, where actions can occur across vast geographical distances, making enforcement challenging. This international dimension necessitates cooperation between countries to address cybercrime, especially as criminals can hide behind the anonymity offered by the Internet. For example, a person accessing illegal content from a country where it's not prohibited raises complex jurisdictional issues. Efforts to address these challenges have led to the creation of international cybercrime treaties, such as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which provides frameworks for cross-border cooperation in combating cybercrime.

Cybercrime spans a wide spectrum, from breaches of personal and corporate privacy—such as data manipulation and identity theft—to transaction-based crimes like fraud and digital piracy. At the extreme end of this spectrum, cyberterrorism involves the deliberate disruption of national infrastructures and public safety through cyberattacks. These activities, including hacking and denial of service attacks, have become more concerning in the wake of incidents like the September 11 attacks. Advanced technologies, such as spyware like Pegasus, have further blurred the lines between law enforcement and cybercrime, as they are used not only for legitimate surveillance but also for covertly tracking individuals without their knowledge, raising significant ethical and legal issues.","1.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/cyberwar,"cyberwar, war conducted in and from computers and the networks connecting them, waged by states or their proxies against other states. Cyberwar is usually waged against government and military networks in order to disrupt, destroy, or deny their use. Cyberwar should not be confused with the terrorist use of cyberspace or with cyberespionage or cybercrime. Even though similar tactics are used in all four types of activities, it is a misinterpretation to define them all as cyberwar. Some states that have engaged in cyberwar may also have engaged in disruptive activities such as cyberespionage, but such activities in themselves do not constitute cyberwar. Computers and the networks that connect them are collectively known as the domain of cyberspace. Western states depend on cyberspace for the everyday functioning of nearly all aspects of modern society, and developing states are becoming more reliant upon cyberspace every year. Everything modern society needs to function from critical infrastructures and financial institutions to modes of commerce and tools for national security depends to some extent upon cyberspace. Therefore, the threat of cyberwar and its purported effects are a source of great concern for governments and militaries around the world, and several serious cyberattacks have taken place that, while not necessarily meeting a strict definition of cyberwar, can serve as an illustration of what might be expected in a real cyberwar of the future. One of the first references to the term cyberwar can be found in Cyberwar Is Coming, a landmark article by John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, two researchers for the RAND Corporation, published in in the journal Comparative Strategy. The cyberspace domain is composed of three layers. The first is the physical layer, including hardware, cables, satellites, and other equipment. Without this physical layer, the other layers cannot function. The second is the syntactic layer, which includes the software providing the operating instructions for the physical equipment. The third is the semantic layer and involves human interaction with the information generated by computers and the way that information is perceived and interpreted by its user. All three layers are vulnerable to attack. Cyberwar attacks can be made against the physical infrastructure of cyberspace by using traditional weapons and combat methods. For example, computers can be physically destroyed, their networks can be interfered with or destroyed, and the human users of this physical infrastructure can be suborned, duped, or killed in order to gain physical access to a network or computer. Physical attacks usually occur during conventional conflicts, such as in the North Atlantic Treaty Organizations NATOs Operation Allied Force against Yugoslavia in and in the U.S.led operation against Iraq in , where communication networks, computer facilities, and telecommunications were damaged or destroyed. Attacks can be made against the syntactic layer by using cyberweapons that destroy, interfere with, corrupt, monitor, or otherwise damage the software operating the computer systems. Such weapons include malware, malicious software such as viruses, trojans, spyware, and worms that can introduce corrupted code into existing software, causing a computer to perform actions or processes unintended by its operator. Other cyberweapons include distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks, in which attackers, using malware, hijack a large number of computers to create so-called botnets, groups of zombie computers that then attack other targeted computers, preventing their proper function. This method was used in cyberattacks against Estonia in April and May and against Georgia in August . On both occasions it is alleged that Russian hackers, mostly civilians, conducted denial of service attacks against key government, financial, media, and commercial Web sites in both countries. These attacks temporarily denied access by the governments and citizens of those countries to key sources of information and to internal and external communications. Finally, semantic cyberattacks, also known as social engineering, manipulate human users perceptions and interpretations of computer generated data in order to obtain valuable information such as passwords, financial details, and classified government information from the users through fraudulent means. Social engineering techniques include phishing in which attackers send seemingly innocuous emails to targeted users, inviting them to divulge protected information for apparently legitimate purposes and baiting, in which malware infected software is left in a public place in the hope that a target user will find and install it, thus compromising the entire computer system. In August , for example, fans of the Anglo-Indian movie star Katrina Kaif were lured into accessing a Web site that was supposed to have a revealing photograph of the actress. Once in the site, visitors were automatically forwarded to a well-known social networking site and asked to enter their login and password. With this information revealed by users, the phishing expedition was successfully completed. An example of baiting involves an incident in in which a flash memory drive infected with malware was inserted into the USB port of a computer at a U.S. military base in the Middle East. From there the computer code spread through a number of military networks, preparing to transfer data to an unnamed foreign intelligence service, before it was detected. As these above examples suggest, semantic methods are used mostly to conduct espionage and criminal activity. The term cyberwar is increasingly controversial. A number of experts in the fields of computer security and international politics question whether the term accurately characterizes the hostile activity occurring in cyberspace. Many suggest that the activities in question can be more accurately described as crime, espionage, or even terrorism but not necessarily as war, since the latter term has important political, legal, and military implications. For example, it is far from apparent that an act of espionage by one state against another via cyberspace equals an act of war just as traditional methods of espionage have rarely, if ever, led to war. Allegations of Chinese cyberespionage bear this out. A number of countries, including India, Germany, and the United States, believe that they have been victims of Chinese cyberespionage efforts. Nevertheless, while these incidents have been a cause of tension between China and the other countries, they have not damaged overall diplomatic relations. Similarly, criminal acts perpetrated in and from cyberspace by individuals or groups are viewed as a matter for law enforcement rather than the military, though there is evidence to suggest that Russian organized crime syndicates helped to facilitate the cyberattacks against Georgia in and that they were hired by either Hamas or Hezbollah to attack Israeli Web sites in January . On the other hand, a cyberattack made by one state against another state, resulting in damage against critical infrastructures such as the electrical grid, air traffic control systems, or financial networks, might legitimately be considered an armed attack if attribution could be proved. Some experts specializing in the laws of armed conflict question the notion that hostile cyber activities can cause war though they are more certain about the use of hostile cyber activities during war. They argue that such activities and techniques do not constitute a new kind of warfare but simply are used as a prelude to, and in conjunction with, traditional methods of warfare. Indeed, in recent years cyberwar has assumed a prominent role in armed conflicts, ranging from the Israeli Hezbollah conflict in Lebanon in to the Russian invasion of Georgia in . In these cases cyberattacks were launched by all belligerents before the actual armed conflicts began, and cyberattacks continued long after the shooting stopped, yet it cannot be claimed that the cyberattacks launched before the start of actual hostilities caused the conflicts. Similarly, the cyberattacks against Estonia in were conducted in the context of a wider political crisis surrounding the removal of a Soviet war memorial from the city centre of Tallinn to its suburbs, causing controversy among ethnic Russians in Estonia and in Russia itself. Such qualifications aside, it is widely believed that cyberwar not only will feature prominently in all future conflicts but will probably even constitute the opening phases of them. The role and prominence of cyberwar in conventional conflicts continues to escalate.","Cyberwar refers to conflict waged in cyberspace, where states or their proxies use digital technologies to attack other nations. Unlike cybercrime, which typically involves individual actors, or cyberespionage, cyberwar is a strategic attack often aimed at disrupting or destroying government or military networks. The primary targets of cyberwar are usually critical infrastructures, communications systems, and defense networks, making such attacks highly disruptive and potentially destructive to national security.

Cyberspace, which encompasses three layers—physical, syntactic, and semantic—is the domain of cyberwar. The physical layer includes hardware and communications infrastructure, the syntactic layer deals with the software controlling systems, and the semantic layer involves human interpretation of data. Cyberwarfare can target any of these layers. Physical attacks can involve traditional weapons or tactics to destroy or damage hardware, while syntactic attacks might use malware, such as viruses, worms, or DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks, to disrupt systems. The 2007 and 2008 DDoS attacks against Estonia and Georgia respectively are prime examples of how cyberweapons can cripple nations’ digital infrastructures.

Semantic attacks, also known as social engineering, manipulate human interactions with data to achieve espionage or criminal objectives. These include techniques like phishing, where attackers deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information, and baiting, where malware is covertly introduced through deceptive means. One notorious instance of baiting occurred in 2008, when a USB flash drive infected with malware was planted at a U.S. military base, allowing the virus to spread across military networks before it was discovered.

Cyberwar has already shown its potential to influence global conflicts, and as nations become more dependent on digital networks for everything from national security to financial systems, the risk of devastating cyberattacks grows. These attacks are often complex, involving a combination of hacking, espionage, and manipulation of public perception, making them difficult to defend against.","1. What is cyberwar?

With the rise of sophisticated threats, organizations face increasing challenges, requiring multi-layered defenses and constant adaptation to keep data and systems secure.

Effective security measures include using technologies like firewalls, antivirus software, and malware protection to safeguard networks, endpoints, and cloud environments. Cloud security, in particular, plays a key role in providing rapid threat detection, especially as hybrid and remote work models grow. Identity security ensures secure access by implementing strong authentication methods and policies.

Cyber threats such as phishing, ransomware, and social engineering continue to pose significant risks. Phishing uses deceptive emails to steal data, ransomware locks systems for ransom, and social engineering tricks individuals into revealing sensitive information. These tactics often work in tandem, requiring comprehensive defense strategies to mitigate them.

Organizations are adopting extended detection and response (XDR) systems for integrated threat detection and quick remediation. Zero-trust security models further enhance safety by limiting access based on specific risks, ensuring only authorized users can interact with systems.

As cyber threats evolve, continuous research and development by cybersecurity professionals are crucial for staying ahead of new vulnerabilities. Cyber resilience strategies, including redundancy, testing, and employee training, ensure organizations can recover from attacks and maintain operational continuity.","1.

httpswwwcoretechusblogcybersecurity-risk-assessment-explained-and-executed,"The most important technology concepts, strategies and actions uncovered for your business. When someone asks you about cybersecurity for your business, what is your response Do you feel strong, confident and informed If so, that's wonderful, but if you're like most business leaders today, this topic might feel a bit foreign and even uncomfortable. That's because cybersecurity covers a wide range of topics, services and tools that have evolved quickly. Cybersecurity is also technically complicated at times, and bad actors operate fast. And now, AI is increasing the number of people who can execute an automated attack effectively. On a positive note, AI is used to improve the prevention of attacks and breaches. Despite that, every organization must face the fact that cyber hacks and security are here to stay or risk devastating consequences. That truth only adds an element of fear to the mix, making these topics much more uncomfortable. It doesn't have to be that way. You can take charge of cybersecurity for your organization, and it starts with understanding the categories of cybersecurity risk assessment reviews. Today, you can understand the foundation of strong cybersecurity the risk assessment. As you learn about cybersecurity risk assessments, it will help you think systematically about your organizations cybersecurity and how you can craft a robust, effective strategy to identify threats and protect your business. A cybersecurity risk assessment is a systematic process that identifies, evaluates, and prioritizes potential cyber threats and vulnerabilities within an organizations IT environment. A proper risk assessment is thorough and requires a framework. It should help you identify and prioritize weak points in your security. It can also point out ways to improve response planning and staff training topics. A cybersecurity risk assessment often serves as an early step in the broader process of building a robust cybersecurity plan to protect your business operations. Generally speaking, you can perform a cyber risk assessment however you want, but professionals in the business have taken the time to create a guide that many IT experts reference when devising risk assessment processes. This guide comes from the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the form of a formal risk management framework. The entire set of documentation will take some time and study to master, but the essentials are laid out in the steps below. An IT support provider that uses this framework can consult with you to build your organizations security posture and create a document that lays out that plan. Details matter when it comes to cybersecurity and protecting your business. What exactly comes under scrutiny during this process What areas need to be covered And what can you really expect from the vulnerability assessment These answers are found by looking at each major category of the assessment You'll find a detailed breakdown of each category below, highlighting exactly how IT service providers in Omaha and Lincoln investigate each category. The foundation of a risk assessment focuses on your assets and what makes them vulnerable. In fact, the NIST framework provides a list of assets and vulnerability categories Hardware and software are fairly straightforward. The assessment will list all of your hardware and software and review vulnerabilities associated with each. Vendor assessment is a little different. There is an evaluation of what access vendors have to your systems and how vendors and their tools might introduce new vulnerabilities to your organization. For example, a vendor regularly delivering receipt paper to a storefront probably has limited access and creates few vulnerabilities. Comparatively, a third-party IT vendor may have high levels of access to your data or systems. This level of access comes with more risk. An interface is a boundary between two or more systems and software elements. Both internal and external interfaces are evaluated for the smooth functioning, communication, security and collaboration internal to the organization. The internal interface assessment focuses on how devices, applications and systems within your organization communicate. Internal interface assessments can include items such as connections between servers, internal networks, employee devices and more. On the other hand, external interface assessments focus on how your systems communicate with outside entities. These assessments typically include remote access tools, cloud services, social media platforms, third-party applications, other institutions, and more. To protect your information technology environment access controls are typically put into place. The cybersecurity assessment evaluates the control models, guidelines, policies, and procedures. How the business safeguards sensitive data is also reviewed. Lastly, application updates come under review. Which systems are out of date and what process are you following to update your applications on a regular basis The best way to view updates is through a thorough audit, and a good risk assessment provides exactly that. Internal threats highlight areas where access control, network segmentation, and sufficient training can preemptively solve problems. Internal threats can be malicious or unintentional, and both require scrutiny due to their potential impacts. Primarily, an internal threat assessment views which parties in your organization have access to which systems. The assessment also gauges how much damage each individual could do, whether maliciously or accidentally. Then recommendations are made to prevent these threats. To put this in perspective, its easy to understand how a disgruntled staff member could implement deliberate harm. For example, a former employee with lingering access to internal systems could intentionally leak sensitive information or disrupt critical operations. A way to mitigate these threats is by implementing strict offboarding procedures that immediately revoke access to all systems when an employee leaves the company, and implementing regular audits of user permissions. What's often easier to miss is how simple password hygiene or social engineering could lead to a security breach. For instance, an employee might fall victim to a phishing email and unintentionally share their login credentials, granting cybercriminals access to the network. To reduce the risk of this unintentional threat, its crucial to implement ongoing security training and enforce best practices like multifactor authentication MFA and regular password updates. Insider errors account for a large number of data breaches every year, and a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment can put that issue into clear focus as well. External threat assessments analyze how attackers from outside your organization could potentially exploit your systems. Some examples of the external threats analyzed by these assessments are phishing attacks, malware, ransomware, and distributed denial of service DDoS attacks. An external threat assessment doesn't just focus on the technical methods an attacker might use, like exploiting insecure interfaces or outdated software. It also examines your organizations overall security posture, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access control policies you have in place. This helps identify vulnerabilities that could leave your organization exposed to external attacks. External threat assessments also provide recommendations based on best practices to prevent, detect and correct controls for your organization. These recommendations can include upgrading outdated software, implementing security awareness training, upgrading your firewall and antimalware tools, as well as deploying intrusion detections. A security focused IT managed services provider knows the tools, best practices, and training to implement to protect, detect and even recover from security incidents. This is where the threat assessment really starts to illuminate the priorities. Each element of the assessment highlights areas for improvement, but the system impact assessment inherently creates a hierarchy of importance. In short, this section looks at your systems to determine mission critical components. The outcome is a business that can better prepare for, mitigate and manage potential risks and threats. Your Omaha and Lincoln Managed IT service provider will present potential outcomes and ways to address the risks associated with system impacts. The final section of your business risk assessment delves into what risks exist for your organization and how best to address them. A robust cybersecurity risk assessment accounts for different kinds of security breaches, so this assessment has to be customized for each organization. The cybersecurity risk response assessment highlights exactly where you need to focus your efforts to reduce your risk. Your final deliverable, the cybersecurity risk assessment, will report on findings for each category reviewed above. Recommendations will also be provided to remediate the areas of risk with the most important tasks identified at the top. Engaging an Omaha or Lincoln IT support provider who knows the importance of cybersecurity and following an IT security framework is important for businesses that want to meet industry or regulatory guidelines, insurance requirements, and best practices. Clearly, every organization needs to take steps to secure their financial, productivity and data assets. When you're ready to dive in, a risk assessment is a valuable tool for your business.

Cybersecurity isn't just about installing firewalls or antivirus software. It’s about creating a comprehensive strategy that involves understanding, evaluating, and managing potential threats across all areas of your business, from internal processes to external attacks.

A cybersecurity risk assessment is the cornerstone of such a strategy. This systematic process identifies and prioritizes vulnerabilities in your organization's IT infrastructure, which can help guide decisions around improvements, resources, and threat responses. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework is a widely respected guide for conducting these assessments, helping businesses frame their security posture effectively.

The assessment typically focuses on several key areas:

Assets and Vulnerabilities: Identifying critical hardware, software, and systems, and evaluating how vulnerable they are to cyber threats.
Internal and External Threats: Analyzing the potential risks from both internal sources (like disgruntled employees or poor password hygiene) and external threats (like phishing, malware, or DDoS attacks).
System Impacts: Understanding the possible consequences of a breach or attack, allowing businesses to prioritize which systems or data are most critical to protect.
Risk Responses: Creating tailored recommendations for mitigating identified risks, from upgrading outdated software to implementing multi-factor authentication and ensuring proper vendor management.
By engaging a professional IT support provider, your business can stay ahead of cybersecurity risks and ensure you're meeting industry standards, regulatory requirements, and best practices to protect your operations, data, and reputation. The assessment will not only highlight where you need to improve but will also provide a clear action plan to strengthen your defenses.

In short, while cybersecurity may feel intimidating, especially with the increasing sophistication of attacks, taking proactive steps through risk assessments can empower your business to defend against both current and future threats.

httpswwwcoretechusblogguide-to-managing-passwords,"The most important technology concepts, strategies and actions uncovered for your business. Cybersecurity is one of the scariest words in modern business, even in Omaha and Lincoln, NE. It feels mysterious and complicated, and to be fair, it is often both of those things. Even so, cybersecurity can realistically be simplified to specific tools and training. If you use good password practices, you eliminate the vast majority of security risks. It actually can be that easy, and it gets even easier when you utilize a password manager. Password managers are useful for safely storing your passwords, and that becomes apparent pretty quickly. How many different passwords do you use in a single day According to research by tech.co, the average person contends with passwords on a regular basis. That's obviously too many to remember. So, the password manager remembers them for you, and that saves you time resetting them. In fact, its so convenient that a lot of people don't even realize that their phones provide native password management. How many times do you have to type a password for an app on your phone If the answer is just once, that's because the phones password manager handles things after that. The convenience of a web based password manager might be obvious, but there's a second, more important reason why you need a password manager password hygiene. What does this mean Password hygiene is a term that describes how healthy and safe your passwords and password related habits are. Youve probably heard the basic rules before. Don't reuse passwords. Make them long. Use letters, numbers, and symbols. A password manager helps you follow these rules. It doesn't just remember passwords for you. Good password manager apps will also suggest strong, secure, unique passwords that are hard to crack. The password manager takes care of password hygiene for you. While its providing convenience, its substantially increasing your business information security in Omaha. In fact, this is worth exploring a little deeper. The World Economic Forum posted an essential study on the matter. If you have an eight digit password that just uses lowercase letters, a malicious attacker can crack it instantaneously. Bump that password up to lowercase letters, and it suddenly takes weeks to crack. Mix in some numbers and symbols and maybe some uppercase letters, and suddenly the same method cant crack your password in the next , years. It doesn't take that much to turn a weak password into a strong one. The problem is that remembering strong passwords is even harder. Thus, the password manager saves the day in more ways than one. Now that you're sold on password managers, how do you actually use one Youve already used something to that effect on your phone, but it doesn't necessarily work with your office computer. Things can get a little hairy and weird. Fortunately, managers are made to simplify life, and you can fully utilize it by learning a handful of easy steps. This seems like a natural place to start. Find a password manager that you like. There are a ton of good ones out there. When you're shopping around, you'll compare the obvious attributes. How much does it cost How hard is it to use many have free trials so you can test that firsthand Does it work with all of your devices Those are all important considerations, but the most important thing to check is extremely easy to overlook. How secure is the password manager Password manager companies devote substantial effort to maintaining their security standards. While using a strong password for the manager is crucial, there's another step that is even more important enabling multifactor authentication MFA for your password manager. If MFA isn't available, its advisable to switch to a different manager. For anyone unclear, MFA is where you put in your password to log into an account, and then you also need to get a temporary security code from a text message or an email. There are other ways to do it too, but the point is that this makes your password manager much, much more secure. Something that can help you understand password managers is learning about the different types Each of these will remember passwords for you, and the vast majority also suggest strong passwords. That said, full feature password management apps are the best way to go for a couple of reasons. First, a browser password manager only works with that one browser. If you use the same browser on all of your devices, it will remember passwords for you across those devices, but it cant remember passwords for apps outside of the browser. That means you need something else to manage those passwords safely. Native device managers tend to run into the same thing Apples Keychain is a prime example. These managers work great on one device such as your phone, but they might not work universally across all of your devices unless you change the settings. Cloud accounts that manage passwords might actually work across all of your devices and apps, but they only work when you have internet access. A full feature app covers all of this. It will work universally on all of your devices. It works whether you're in a browser or using a different app. It does sync across the cloud, but it can also work offline. Its the ultimate solution. With all of that covered, how do you actually use the manager once you pick one They're pretty intuitive, but a quick guide will make sure you're in the know. First, you have to set up the password manager with an account. It will walk you through this when you install it for the first time. That's when you will pick your master password for the manager its the only password you need to remember now. Its also when you set up multifactor authentication. Don't skip that. Once that is done, you can start filling in passwords. Every time you type in a password on a device that has the manager installed, it will offer to remember that password. Even better, you can ask it to suggest a strong password using the password generator feature and update that account record. In fact, this is a good idea. Start with the accounts you use and care about the most, and make sure you have a strong password on each of them. Its ok if it takes a little while to get through your list, but ultimately, you want all of your passwords to be strong and remembered by the manager. From there, as long as you allow the manager to run, it will take care of the rest. It will recommend passwords whenever you create a new account, and it will remember every password indefinitely. It will also automatically update passwords if you have to change them. If you happen to work in a leadership role in your place of business, you might consider standardizing password managers in the workplace. That's a good idea. If you want to ensure that everyone is using the manager to good effect, consider a couple of things. First, pay for a company account for the manager. You can usually get bulk rates to have dozens of users and more if needed. This gets all of your staff on the same manager which makes it easier to support, and it removes any barrier to entry. From there, offer training to use the manager. Many people wont need training, but some might. If that training is available, you get rid of excuses, and everyone wins. That's really it. If you make things easy, people tend to like it. Password managers can do that for you, and you can do that for people in your place of work.

One of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect your organization is by using a password manager, which helps ensure proper password hygiene.

Why Use a Password Manager?
The average person deals with around 100 passwords daily, making it nearly impossible to remember each one securely. This is where a password manager steps in, allowing you to store, retrieve, and generate strong, unique passwords. They significantly enhance security by eliminating the risks associated with reusing weak passwords.

A password manager doesn’t just store passwords—it also helps create secure, complex passwords. For example, an 8-character lowercase password can be cracked instantly by attackers. But by using a password manager to generate a password with a mix of uppercase letters, symbols, and numbers, you can create a password that would take millennia to crack.

How to Choose and Use a Password Manager
When selecting a password manager, consider these key points:

Security: Look for strong encryption and multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA is a critical step in ensuring that your password manager is protected.
Ease of use: It should sync across all your devices and work with apps outside your browser, giving you the flexibility to access your passwords no matter where you are.
A full-feature app is the best option since it works seamlessly across devices, including offline, and can manage all passwords, whether they're for websites or apps. Examples include 1Password, LastPass, and Dashlane, which offer robust features such as password generation, secure sharing, and regular updates to ensure compliance with security best practices.

Ensuring Compliance in Your Organization
For businesses, implementing password managers across the company is an excellent way to streamline security practices. Consider:

Providing access to a company account to ensure all staff are on the same system.
Offering training to ensure everyone understands how to use the tool effectively, which can remove barriers to adoption.
By making cybersecurity practices like password management easy and accessible, you help create a more secure environment for your business and its sensitive data.

For more details on password managers and cybersecurity best practices, you can check resources from organizations like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or explore additional reading on password management tools.
