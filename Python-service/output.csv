**Types of Cyber Attacks:**

1. **Phishing Attacks**: Tricking individuals into revealing sensitive information through deceptive emails, messages, or websites.
2. **Malware**: Harmful programs that compromise system integrity, including viruses, worms, trojans, and other malicious software.
3. **Ransomware**: Encrypting files and demanding payment for their release, posing a severe threat to businesses and individuals.
4. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: Intercepting and altering communication between two parties, leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation.
5. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks**: Overwhelming a system, server, or network, rendering it inaccessible to users.
6. **SQL Injection**: Manipulating a web application's database by injecting malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
7. **Zero-Day Exploits**: Targeting unknown vulnerabilities in software before developers release a fix, making them highly potent.
8. **Social Engineering**: Manipulating individuals into divulging sensitive information by exploiting trust and human psychology.

**Prevention Tips:**

* Be cautious of unexpected emails or links, and verify the legitimacy of requests before sharing personal information.
* Keep antivirus software updated, avoid downloading from untrusted sources, and conduct regular system scans.
* Regularly back up important data, use reputable security software, and exercise caution when opening email attachments.
* Use encrypted communication channels such as HTTPS, and be wary of unsecured public Wi-Fi networks.
* Employ DDoS protection services, monitor network traffic for anomalies, and have a robust incident response plan.
* Regularly update software, implement parameterized queries, and conduct security audits.
* Keep software updated, use intrusion detection systems, and stay informed about emerging vulnerabilities.
* Educate employees on social engineering tactics, implement multi-factor authentication, and encourage skepticism.",,
https://medium.com/@Cyb3rsecurity/vulnerability-scanning-v-s-penetration-testing-1214980c54ec,"Here is a summary of the content related to cybersecurity and cyberattacks:

**Penetration Testing:**

* Involves a human factor and requires extremely experienced testers
* Targets specific functions, departments, or assets based on risk and importance
* Can take days to weeks to complete and may cause outages
* Testers exploit vulnerabilities, including unknown ones, and require high-skilled knowledge
* Penetration testers are knowledgeable in:
	+ Black hat attack methodologies (e.g., remote access attacks, SQL injection)
	+ Internal and external testing
	+ Web front-end technologies, web application programming languages, web APIs, network technologies, networking protocols, operating systems, and scripting languages
	+ Testing tools (e.g., Nessus, Metasploit)

**Vulnerability Scanning:**

* Automated process to identify potential vulnerabilities in network devices, servers, and applications
* Does not exploit vulnerabilities, only identifies potential ones
* Wider in scope than penetration testing, requiring automated tools to manage a high number of assets
* Can be run frequently to detect and patch known vulnerabilities quickly
* Vulnerability management can feed into patch management for effective patching

**Comparison:**

* Penetration testing is a deep, thorough examination of network security, while vulnerability scanning provides a quick insight into network security
* Both tests work together to encourage optimal network and application security
* Penetration testing is expensive, but provides a thorough examination of network security, while vulnerability scanning is a cost-effective way to identify potential vulnerabilities.",,
https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/business-security/beyond-checkbox-demystifying-cybersecurity-compliance/,"Here is a summary of the content related to cybersecurity and cyberattacks:

* Cyberattacks are a rising and relentless threat to businesses, making cybersecurity compliance crucial for safeguarding assets, reputation, and business survival.
* Governments and regulatory agencies are increasingly recognizing the importance of cybersecurity, leading to an expanding set of compliance requirements.
* Compulsory compliance regulations, such as HIPAA, NIST, PCI DSS, NIS2, and GDPR, target companies operating in critical infrastructure sectors and aim to protect sensitive data.
* Failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines, data breaches, ransomware attacks, and even criminal penalties.
* Cybersecurity compliance is not just for security vendors, but for any company that handles sensitive data or operates in critical infrastructure sectors.
* Key cybersecurity acts and frameworks include HIPAA, NIST, PCI DSS, NIS2, and GDPR, each with unique requirements and penalties for non-compliance.
* Non-compliance can result in significant financial penalties, loss of contracts, and damage to reputation.
* Cybersecurity compliance should be built into the foundations of any business strategy, and companies should view it as an essential and regular investment to protect their business and reputation.",,

* Be cautious when clicking on links and downloading files
* Use a reputable adware remover tool to remove adware from your device

**Legal Aspects:**

* Some types of adware are illegal in the US, depending on state and federal laws
* Installing adware without user consent is illegal in some states
* Causing damage to 10 or more computers within a year can result in felony charges under federal law",,
https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/cybercrime/dont-become-statistic-defending-data-dark-web/,"Here is a summary of the article, focusing only on the cybersecurity and cyberattack-related information:

**Cyberattack Risks:**

* 44% of European Parliament members and 68% of British MPs had their personal details exposed on the dark web due to third-party data breaches.
* Cybercriminals can buy and sell stolen data, hacking tools, and other malicious materials on the dark web.
* A staggering 40% of British, European, and French parliamentarians' email addresses were exposed on the dark web, with 700 of these emails having associated passwords stored in plain text.
