"One of Meta's key security initiatives is business verification, requiring businesses to confirm their identities before accessing certain tools. This helps ensure that users can trust the brands they interact with. Additionally, Meta strengthens account security by requiring large global business users to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for accessing business tools. This measure helps prevent unauthorized access and activities, such as adding or removing users or creating ads.

"One of Meta's key security initiatives is business verification, requiring businesses to confirm their identities before accessing certain tools. This helps ensure that users can trust the brands they interact with. Additionally, Meta strengthens account security by requiring large global business users to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for accessing business tools. This measure helps prevent unauthorized access and activities, such as adding or removing users or creating ads. Meta also uses machine learning to detect suspicious behavior, such as unusual spending in advertising campaigns or logins from unexpected locations, and swiftly investigates potential threats. Automated systems like account logouts after inactivity further enhance security.","What is Meta's business verification process?","Requiring businesses to confirm their identities before accessing certain tools"
