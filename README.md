# Cyber-Detective

## Introduction:
Investigating and attributing cyber-attacks are crucial processes that allow cybersecurity experts to implement efficient countermeasures and pursue legal actions. Cyber-attack attribution helps identify the attackers responsible for cyber-attacks, enabling experts to take attacker-oriented countermeasures.

This project, RAG-Cyber-Detective, aims to develop a web-based Question Answering (QA) model that assists cybersecurity experts in their investigations. The QA model will provide answers to queries based on either a curated knowledge base (KB) or external resources provided by users, utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques together with a Large Language Model (LLM).
